# Klossus-kolussus

## Final project C#.NET Spring 23. 
We had two weeks to come up with and finish a project to present on our graduation day. The last few weeks leading up to this we had mainly been focusing och ASP.NET MVC projects and we a as group thought it would be a great opportunity to learn somehting new. We came up with the idea of building a tetris in Unity. None of us had any previous knowledge of the game engine so the first couple of days went by just to get a hang of how it works. 

### Why tetris?
It seemed like a simple but complex game to build asa first game. You have to control each tetris piece - how it moves, how it rotates and how its rotating behaves when its rotating either clockwise or counter clockwise when interacting with the game borders. The next issues was clearing lines. When a tetris block lands that block leads to a line clear all objects covering that/those specific lines is to be removed. With this logic our tetris pieces had to be built by an arrays of squares, each taking up a position in the two dimensional game board. It was sure a fun challenge and two weeks full of learning.

### Project workflow and team setups
This project is made by a team of five. Myself (Jean), Lucas, Haris, Simon and Ibrahim. We planned the projects using the bullet points below, although more in detail. After we had decided har MVP we made wireframes for our game. During the project we had an agile work flow with daily standups go through yesterdays work and alocated each person in the project an assignment for the day. 

### MVP
- Working single player tetris ✓
- Score counter ✓
- Level system ✓
- Menu ✓

### Nice-to-have
- Leaderboard ✓ (only for single-player)
- Co-op mode ✓
- Sounds effects ✓


Feel free to clone the repository to try it out. You will need to open it in Unity to be able to create the file locally if you want to run it on your computer.
